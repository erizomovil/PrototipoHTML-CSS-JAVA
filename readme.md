# RinconLiterario

It's a Web of a library to lease and buy book.


## Getting started

To understand the structure, the page its divaded in Header, navbar, intro, cards, contact, stores and footer.

The header is the first thing you see, it has no function other than showing the name of the web.

The navbar has some tools to move around the page and some more information about the company.

The intro has a welcoming and an explanation of what we do and our pasion for books.

The cards have the covers of the books we offer and ther tittle and author and if you click on them you can see their Book Blurb.

Contact, which only provides information.

Stores which has information on our stores.

And the footer.

With the navbar you can now travel to a new page and travel back to the welcome page.

New page with a form to help the user find the books he wants.

A list that shows the books the user is looking for.

Now the list of books is saved in the user localstorage.

And there's an option for administrators to add new books, change its information and delte books
